LANCER LA CoMMADE DANS UNE SHELL
git clone https://github.com/gavinfielder/pft.git pft_2019 && echo "pft_2019/" >> .gitignore && cd pft_2019 && rm unit_tests.c && rm options-config.ini && git clone https://github.com/cclaude42/PFT_2019.git temp && cp temp/unit_tests.c . && cp temp/options-config.ini . && rm -rf temp


Usage
Warning : everytime you change your printf, you need to make re in PFT again.

In the PFT_2019 repo, run make re

You can now run all the tests using ./test

To run only %s tests for example, you can use ./test s

To run tests #42 to #84, you can use ./test 42 84

Credit
The code was written by Gavin Fielder. This is an update of the test file by cclaude, with some tests removed and some added, for easier use with the 2019 printf subject.

Thanks to lnezonde and macrespo for their help debugging and their suggestions.
